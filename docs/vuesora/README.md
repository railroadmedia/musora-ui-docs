# Vuesora

Vuesora is a custom Javascript Component library built on [Vue.js](). Vuesora's components should be used wherever complex DOM manipulation or app-like functionality is required.

#### Power of Components
<br>

Vuesora's components are all inclusive, self contained modules of front-end code. They include content, style, and functionality.

#### Considerations
<br>

Vuesora's components are rendered on the Client-Side, meaning the compents and their content will not render until the javascript loads. Because this kind of Javascript is not used as an enhancement to the HTML markup, but is 'all inclusive', you should add a `<nonscript>` for users who may not have JS enabled.

```html
<noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to see this content.</noscript>
```

###### Search Engines

Javascript components are not available to search engines because search crawlers only index HTML content. If you need to build an SEO friendly experience and want to write reusable code, consider using Bladesora Components that are Server-Side rendered.
